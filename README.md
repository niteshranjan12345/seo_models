The dataset includes textual descriptions (e.g., “Luxury hotel in Udaipur with spa”) and numerical features (e.g., LCP, FID, CLS, page size, mobile-friendliness). A custom CWV score (0–100) is calculated using a weighted formula: 40% LCP, 30% FID, 30% CLS, aligning with Google’s thresholds (Good: LCP ≤ 2.5s, FID ≤ 100ms, CLS ≤ 0.1). BERT (bert-base-uncased) generates embeddings for descriptions, combined with scaled numerical features, to train a neural network head for regression. The model achieves low MSE (~5–15), identifying top 12 websites with high CWV scores (>80, strong SERP potential) and top 12 with low scores (<50, poor SERP performance). Feature importance, derived via Random Forest, highlights LCP, FID, and CLS as key predictors. Outputs include the dataset, ranked lists, and a feature importance plot. Designed for Bidinn (www.bidinn.in), the model guides SEO optimization by prioritizing user experience metrics.
